  <h1>The Doctrine of Christ: A Foundational Guide for Personal Conversion</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Doctrine of Christ is the foundation upon which all true conversion rests. Taught clearly in both ancient and modern scripture and reaffirmed through the Restoration of the gospel, it outlines the essential steps by which individuals come unto Christ and receive salvation. This guide seeks to define, clarify, and apply each element of the Doctrine of Christ in practical ways that foster personal spiritual growth and deepen discipleship.</p>
